## Connect Ipad to monitor

First, It does not matter what type of device you have to be able to monitor your device. You can definetly use windows. 

Yow will need to download spacedesk on both ipad and windows computer. Make sure both devices have the same connection. Once that is completed, make sure you grab the appropiate USB C cable and connect your ipad to your laptop/computer. 

On spacedesk, you will need to make sure the device is listed then will click on the device. The devices will now be connected. 

At first, the ipad will just be mirroring your computer. Unless you change the setting. On your computer, you will press F8. It will give you options, PC screen, Duplicate, Extend, Second screen only. You will choose extend because you get to put a specific page or whatever you will like and put on ipad and for your computer, you will have something else to work on.
