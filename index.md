## Github Starter

When using github it can look overwhelmed. Once you get the hang of it, it doesn't seem so bad. I am still learning, I won't know a lot in one day. Take time and keep practicing. Eventually you will get the hang of it.

As a beginner, this would seem like a lot of work. Some advice I would give would be take your time to get use to everything. As time goes by everything will start making sense. You won't learn all in a day, so don't be hard on yourself. Just keep practicing. Pay attention on your wording and apps necessary to build your website. 

When I first started to create my website, there was a whole process before actually entering information recarding the website.
