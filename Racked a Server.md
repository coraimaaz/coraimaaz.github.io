# Racked a Server

I have never racked a sever before but wasn't too bad. It's a two person job so don't think you aren't capable to do it, you just need some assistance. 

At first you will need a rack and you need to make sure that the rack is attach to both sides of the rack. There was some situations being able to connect both sides, so I needed to unscrew the bolts to make the rack fit better than I screwed the bolts back on. 

Once that is completed, you and another person will both grab the server from each side and will carefully placed the serve onto the rack. The server needs to be connected to the rack holes to perfectly fit. 

Just like that, you have successfully racked a server.
